UXN:
./uxnasm [.tal file] or use the launcher.rom's self-compiler

unfunny linux:
make
not really much more to it

gba:
rename the "gamegirl.make" to makefile
finally, just run make
(famous last words)

if it halts and catches fire, try again or file a bug report.
if it's reading your time wrong, make sure your actual clock is correct first
if it's telling your time of death, I would exorcise your computing station of spirits first
if it's stuck on the exact moment the Titanic sunk, i cannot help you
